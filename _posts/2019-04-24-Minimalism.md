A minimalist pursues a simple life and buys necessary objects to decorate their lovely bases that make them feel comfortable. Their bases are called by another cool name that is a wonderful sanctuary. People tending to minimalism often dislike noise and a haphazard life. However, an opposite view usually exists to boost the degree of interest up. That’s individuals bring noise, boisterous aura, and negative enthusiasm wherever they go. They absolutely hate peace and silence.

Therefore, there was a tension between two schools: Minimalism and “Maximalism”. It was totally a serious friction. No one accepted to give up their opinion, why? Because they were as stubborn as mule. They tried to tell their evidence and stories to prove that their opinions were permanently true through time and space and persuade as many people as possible to join in their “best ever team”. Each of them believed that their school was doing the right things, and they were not firmly on the wrong track with a bullish mood. Fortunately, an expert appeared and stated one fact that he had researched from historical events, and dissected the tension that lasted a decade. The fact is… Can you guess?
