*Eccentric*

*Drown*

*Stumble*

*Bounce*

*Introvert*


Simon and Jack are best friends each other, but their personalities are completely different. Simon is an introvert, and Jack is an extrovert. Since Simon is such an introvert, he sometimes has ridiculous behavior and weird speech, and he is considered as an eccentric in some ways. One day, Jack found a small cave behind their school, and he asked Simon to explore the mysterious cave after school. Fortunately, Simon accepted to go with Jack. After their last class, they rendezvous at the school gate and head to the cave. Eventually, they had reached the cave and entered the cave with the first steps. Because of the darkness, Simon deliberately stumbled over a rock, lost his balance and fell down into a lake that they even did not know where the lake was. Fortunately, Jack found a torch on the ground, and used it to look up his friend. He finally found Simon and he rescued him on time. Otherwise, he would have drown. After that, Simon was immediately hospitalized. The following two days, he bounced back quickly, and he was discharged from the hospital. Now, he gradually joins outdoor activities actively, and he is no longer considered as an eccentric.
