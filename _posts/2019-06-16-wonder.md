Today I am not writing a story but I try to translate a song's lyric from Vietnamese to English: Thắc Mắc - Thinh Suy (Wonder - Think Suy). To be honest, I am running out of ideas to write a new story. 😂

Here we go!!! 

Prechorus:<br>
Chỉ là chút thắc mắc theo anh rối bời<br>
*Just a bit of wonder has dumped me in a stir and a jumble*<br>
Chỉ là chút khói bên trong mặt trời...<br>
*Just a bit of smoke lives iniside the sun...*<br>

Chorus:<br>
Có lẽ em đã khóc rất nhiều <br>
*You could have cried a lot*

Có lẽ anh chẳng cảm nhận được bao nhiêu <br>
*I have suspected how much I could have felt you*


Điều đó...anh không thể biết em à! <br>
*Those are obstacles... I am not able to comprehend why they are so, Bae!*

Có lẽ em chẳng khóc chút nào <br>
*You could not have thought that crying for our love has been your pet peeve*<br>
Có lẽ em chẳng quan tâm anh ra sao<br>
*Striving my thought could have been a thing that you had never ever cultivated*<br>
Điều đó...anh không thể biết em à. vì giờ mình đã xa!<br>
*Those things... are not pereived by my logic, Bae. Cuz we are in apart now!*

Verse 2 :<br>
Sau chia tay không thấy em chụp hình đăng face<br>
*After our breakup, photos of you have been no longer posted on Facebook. (your photos have been delivered on my Favebook feed)*<br>
Một ngày anh thử tìm kiếm... tên em đã không xuất hiện<br>
*One day I gave myself a try... your FB account did not exist anymore (cuz you are being blocked 🤣)*

Vẫn là chút thắc mắc theo anh rối bời<br>
*Still along with a bit of wonder has dumped me in a stir and a jumble*<br>
Vẫn là chút khói bên trong mặt trời<br>
*Still along with a bit of smoke lives iniside the sun...<br>

Chorus: <br>
Có lẽ em đã khóc rất nhiều<br>
*You could have cried a lot*<br>
Có lẽ anh chẳng cảm nhận được bao nhiêu<br>
*Probably my feelings of you have not articulated*<br>

Điều đó...anh không thể biết em à!<br>
*Those are obstacles... I am not able to comprehend why they are so, Bae!*<br>

Có lẽ em chẳng khóc chút nào<br>
*You could not have thought that crying for our love has been your pet peeve*<br>
Có lẽ em chẳng quan tâm anh ra sao<br>
*Striving my thought could have been a thing that you had never ever cultivated*<br>
Điều đó...anh không thể biết em à. vì giờ mình đã xa!<br>
*Striving my thought could have been a thing that you had never ever cultivated*<br>

__Comment: Trapping ourself into a wonder of a broken love is a double-edged sword, and this song tells all the reasons.__
